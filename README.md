**Please view file Full_Report.pdf for the detailed procedure I used and insights generated.**

As a a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. I need to answer the following questions by different approaches.
1. What are some trends in smart device usage? 
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


With the questions in mind, the follwing deliverables are finally what I need to present.
1. A clear summary of the business task 
2. A description of all data sources used 
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data 
4. A summary of your analysis 
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings 
6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

To complete the analysis, I will use the 6 stages of analysis process as a guide. 
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act
